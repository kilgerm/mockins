Mockins
--------

Mockins is a mock instructor. It's purpose is to help you dealing with mocking in unit tests.


.Mockins is for you if you are familiar with the following problem:  
* you have (legacy) code without unit tests
* naive invocation of the method to test yields a NullPointer
* reason: some parameter or field may not be null, or may not return null when called
* but it is far from clear where to start with mocking/stubbing
* so you best try is to mock and stub everything...

  
.Example
[source,java]
// This is the class you would like to test
MyClass classUnderTest = new MyClass();
// first, create a "instructed"
instructed = Mockins.instruct(classUnderTest);
// then call whatever method you would like to test...
classUnderTest.testMethod(null);
// ...this will run testMethod and try to add mocks/stubs for parameters and fields so that the method does not throw a NPE!
